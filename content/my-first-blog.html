  I thought it would be fun to start a blog just to write about some things that I'm interested in. This doesn't have to be technology-based (I do have other interests, surprisingly), but it most likely will be. There's not much to write in this post... this is mainly me testing if this website works. So I guess I'll just blurt random things out.

<h2>My re-entry into philosophy</h2>
<p>
  
I was interested in philosophy a few years back in college. When I finished, however, I had too little time to get into it like I once was. But luckily, I have more free time than ever right now! I started by reading <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Think-Compelling-Introduction-Simon-Blackburn/dp/0192854259/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1XJKKLJV59BYN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.HdhtLgTPvofYxJfKJAPkL31o1i0iiUdQf1Gu1XRAoIsCt3xN9D5aw1a_PYF_kJ8QiKz0YRRNZpOxu_i-sIcItXRSNefw6n93tzH-cyeF7S4.bYVH3zfSX_DF0SZHA-EwuYREQbnxcDviz8VBYloqnQk&dib_tag=se&keywords=think+simon+blackburn&qid=1747146964&sprefix=think+sim%2Caps%2C135&sr=8-1">Think - Simon Blackburn</a>, which was a great first step back. Currently finishing up <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Animal-Farm-George-Orwell/dp/1840228032/ref=sr_1_3?crid=22D4VZIYZDCQ4&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.13wq-BSoyIIOAQJo4acuQKgC8x7Hx-odnPGMFZqMCbyT3V4hYV_k-_BJK6UeZxpwLC4_0BghIj8epQHDsRNSnaacDlWhp9mpddvyykG3GoOaKJMvmVitnNxebj2dQKfWOOQzYP6ZjEsuB43vzGZdR5Jb8lk9rl1sGDNiEycjyqiEOAnJuqUKSllCWkXWE-D2IKudIUdNSdHOu-OZzmdN04lXDD6AiSfcfHf0FFwvkzc.mYwpn00kxE9iG9bdPeIhyeKqaYexYUwi4qcU1gIu1TM&dib_tag=se&keywords=animal+farm&qid=1747146987&sprefix=ani%2Caps%2C91&sr=8-3">Animal Farm - Geroge Orwell</a>.  My goal this time around is to get my feet wet with sections of philosophy I avoided when I was 17, like ethics and political philosophy.

<h2>I modded my 3DS recently</h2>
<p>
  I had an urge to revitalise my 3DS from 2012 (honestly not quite sure how it's survived over a decade) and it was an amazing decision! I LEGALLY got all my games that I used to play as a kid plus a few new games that I never got to play. Every time I have to travel for over an hour I always find myself taking it with me! Very happy with the decision to mod it :)
